About
=====

This document describes ClaimStore, a new proposed mini service that
permits to exchange information about information claims within a set
of collaborating heterogeneous information services.

A primary use case example is the exchange of information about
persistent identifiers (such as DOI) in the domain of astrophysics and
particle physics among `ADS <http://adswww.harvard.edu/>`_, `arXiv
<http://arxiv.org/>`_, and `INSPIRE <http://inspirehep.net/>`_
services.  This would permit to better track and disambiguate papers,
offer cross-linking between services, or offer cross-search between
services.

The driving idea behind ClaimStore is to offer a neutral micro-service
that would be (1) storing claims that various collaborating services
perform and (2) answering questions about claims.
